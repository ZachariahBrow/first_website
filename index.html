        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there, my name is Zachariah Brown. This is my senior year of high school, and my 4th and final year of being in the highschool computer science program. I decided to join the program (or career pathway) in my freshman year, because that is when I had decided that I want my life outside of school to involve technology, more specifically computers. I know how and love to build them, and am currently learning how to program different things about them. Over the years, I have been taught how to code in python, and currently learning a little bit of HTML. Iverall, I would say that it is an amaizing thing to learn, and it would really help out in the future woth the world becoming mainly technology. I would recommend this program for anyone intreseted in coding or even people who are intreseted in computers (whether it be hardware or software). It defenitly takes some time to learn, so sticking with it is a good idea. </p>
        <p>When I was little, I never really grew up with what I have today. Yes, we had a laptop but it was nothing fancy. I would play video games on a Wii or an Xbox 360, but that was about it. It wasn't until I could watch a Youtube video and understand what they were saying when I figured out that I had wanted to learn about computers. Of course, it was mainly for my intrest in video games, but here recently, I have learned that they are used for a lot more than that, and that there ia a lot more to learn than just building them, that there is a entirely different world when it comes to these types of things. I would defenitly say that technology has taken over my life, but what could be better than spending your time learning about these very intresting things! And let me tell you, building computers are way different than programming. Think of building them as very expensive legos for adults.</p>
